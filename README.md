# Example CorDapp

Welcome to the example CorDapp. This README is an abridged version of 
the [CorDapp tutorial](http://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html) found on
the Corda docsite.

**Instead, if you are interested in exploring the Corda codebase itself,
contributing to the core Corda platform or viewing and running sample
demos then clone the [corda repository](https://github.com/corda/corda).**

The code in the CorDapp tutorial implements the _"Hello World"_ of
CorDapps. It allows users of a Corda node to generate and send IOUs to other 
nodes. You can also enumerate all the IOU which have been agreed with other 
nodes. The nodes also provide a simple web interface which can be used to 
interact with the CorDapp.

The source code for this CorDapp is provided in both Kotlin (under `/kotlin-source`)
and Java (under `/java-source`), and users can choose to write their CorDapps in
either language.

## The Example CorDapp

The Example CorDapp implements a basic scenario where a buyer wishes to
submit IOUs to a seller. The scenario defines four nodes:

* **Controller** which hosts the network map service and validating notary
  service.
* **NodeA** who is the buyer.
* **NodeB** who is the seller.
* **NodeC** an unrelated third party.

NodeA can generate IOUs. The flows used to facilitate the agreement process 
always result in an agreement with the seller as long as the IOU meets the 
contract constraints which are defined in `IOUContract`.

All agreed IOUs between NodeA and NodeB become "shared facts"
between NodeA and NodeB. However, NodeC won't see any of these
transactions or receive copies of the resulting `IOUState`
objects. This is because data is only propagated on a need-to-know
basis.

You can generate a diagram of this flow using Gradle, by running:

**Unix:** 

     ./gradlew generateFlowDiagram
     
**Windows:**

     gradlew.bat generateFlowDiagram

The resulting flow diagram will be placed under ``kotlin-source/build/doc`` and 
``java-source/build/doc``.

## Pre-Requisites

You will need the following installed on your machine before you can start:

* [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
  installed and available on your path.
* Latest version of [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) 
  (note the community edition is free)
* [h2 web console](http://www.h2database.com/html/download.html)
  (download the "platform-independent zip")
* git

For more detailed information, see the
[getting set up](https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html) page on the
Corda docsite.

## Getting Set Up

To get started, clone this repository with:

     git clone https://github.com/corda/cordapp-tutorial.git

Change directories to the newly cloned repo:

     cd cordapp-tutorial
     
Check out the latest milestone release tag (currently `release-M12.1`):

     git checkout -b [your-branch-name] release-M12.1
     
Non-milestone releases are development branches, and can be unstable 
or even broken. You should develop against a milestone release.
     
## Build the example CorDapp

**NOTE: Building the example CorDapp from master WILL fail without 
first running `./gradlew install` (or `gradlew.bat install`) from the master
branch of the [corda repository](https://github.com/corda/corda). Make sure
you have checked out the M11 release tag from this repository before you build,
UNLESS you wish to build from a SNAPSHOT release.**
 
**Unix:** 

     ./gradlew deployNodes
     
**Windows:**

     gradlew.bat deployNodes
     
This will build the example CorDapp. Any changes you wish to make to the 
CorDapp should be made before running this build step, of course!
     
Gradle will grab all the dependencies for you from Maven and then build 
two sample applications and create several local Corda nodes.

## Running the Nodes

Once the build concludes, change directories to the folder where the newly 
built nodes are located:

**Kotlin:**

     cd kotlin-source/build/nodes

**Java:**

     cd java-source/build/nodes
     
The Gradle build script will have created a folder for each node. You'll
see three folders, one for each node and a `runnodes` script. You can
run the nodes with:

**Unix:**

     sh runnodes --log-to-console --logging-level=DEBUG

**Windows:**

    runnodes.bat --log-to-console --logging-level=DEBUG

You should now have four Corda nodes running on your machine serving 
the example CorDapp. (There are other logging levels, i.e. INFO and TRACE.)

When the nodes have booted up you should see a message like: 

     Node started up and registered in 5.007 sec
     
in the console.

For a much more detailed description of building and running the Example
CorDapp see the
[Cordapp tutorial](https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html) on the
Corda docsite.

## Interacting with the CorDapp via HTTP

The CorDapp defines a couple of HTTP API end-points and also serves some
static web content. The end-points allow you to list agreements and add
agreements.

The nodes can be found using the following port numbers, defined in
`build.gradle` and the respective `node.conf` file for each node found
in `kotlin-source/build/nodes/NodeX` or `java-source/build/nodes/NodeX`:

     NodeA: localhost:10007
     NodeB: localhost:10010
     NodeC: localhost:10013

Also, as the nodes start-up they should tell you which host and port the
embedded web server is running on. The API endpoints served are as follows:

     /api/example/me
     /api/example/peers
     /api/example/ious
     /api/example/{COUNTERPARTY}/create-iou
     
The static web content is served from:

     /web/example
     
An IOU can be created via accessing the
`create-iou` end-point directly or through the the web form
hosted at `/web/example`.

**NOTE: The content in `web/example` is only available for demonstration
purposes and does not implement any anti-XSS/XSRF security techniques. Do
not copy such code directly into products meant for production use.**

**Submitting an IOU via HTTP API:**

To create an IOU from NodeA to NodeB, use:

     curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:10007/api/example/create-iou?iouValue=99&partyName=CN%3DNodeB%2CO%3DNodeB%2CL%3DNew%20York%2CC%3DUS'

Note the port number `10007` (NodeA), the IOU value `99` and the counterparty name `CN=NodeB,O=NodeB,L=New York,C=US` 
referenced in the end-point path. This command instructs NodeA to create and send an IOU
to NodeB. Upon verification and completion of the process, both nodes
(but not NodeC) will have a signed, notarised copy of the IOU.

**Submitting an IOU via `web/example`:**

Click the "Create IOU" button at the top left of the page and enter the IOU 
details, e.g.

     Counter-party: CN=NodeB,O=NodeB,L=New York,C=US
     Value:  1

and click "Create IOU". The modal dialogue should close.

To check what validation is performed on the IOU data, have a look 
at the `Create` class in `IOUContract`. For example, Entering a
'Country Code' other than 'UK' will cause the verify function to return an
Exception and you should rceeive an error message in response.

**Viewing the submitted IOU:**

Inspect the terminal for the nodes. You should see some activity in the
terminal windows for NodeA and NodeB:

*NodeA:*

     Generating transaction based on new IOU.
     Verifying contract constraints.
     Signing transaction with our private key.
     Sending proposed transaction to recipient for review.
     Done

*NodeB:*

     Receiving proposed transaction from sender.
     Verifying signatures and contract constraints.
     Signing proposed transaction with our private key.
     Obtaining notary signature and recording transaction.
     Done

*NodeC:*

     You shouldn't see any activity.


**NOTE: These progress tracking messages are not currently visible in the Nodes, but they are visible on the NodeA WebServer terminal. Running the nodes with log-level DEBUG or TRACE should reveal extra activity when creating a new IOU.**

Alternatively, try adding an IOU with a delivery date in the past 
or a delivery country other than the UK.

Next you can view the newly created IOU by accessing the
vault of NodeA or NodeB:

**Via the HTTP API:**

For NodeA. navigate to
`http://localhost:10007/api/example/ious`. For NodeB,
navigate to `http://localhost:10010/api/example/ious`.

**Via web/example:**

Navigate to `http://localhost:10007/web/example/` and click the refresh
button at the top left-hand side of the page. You should see the newly
created IOU on the page.

## Accessing a Node's Database via the h2 Web Console

You can connect to the h2 database to see the current state of the
ledger, among other data such as the network map cache.

Firstly, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the h2 web console
as part of the pre-requisites section, above.

Change directories to the bin folder:

     cd h2/bin
     
Where there are a bunch of shell scripts and batch files. Run the web
console:

**Unix:**

     sh h2.sh
     
**Windows::**

     h2.bat
     
The h2 web console should start up in a web browser tab. To connect we
first need to obtain a JDBC connection string. Each node outputs its
connection string in the terminal window as it starts up. In a terminal
window where a node is running, look for the following string:

     Database connection url is      : jdbc:h2:tcp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx/node
     
you can use the string on the right to connect to the h2 database: just
paste it in to the `JDBC URL` field and click *Connect* (leave the default username/password).

You will be presented with a web application that enumerates all the
available tables and provides an interface for you to query them using SQL.

## Using the Example RPC Client

`ExampleClientRPC` is a simple utility class which uses the client
RPC library to connect to a node and log the 'placed' IOUs.
It will log any existing IOUs and listen for any future
IOUs. To build the client use the following gradle task:

     ../gradlew runExampleClientRPC
     
To run the client:

**Via IntelliJ:**

Select the 'Run Example RPC Client' run configuration which, by default,
connects to NodeA (RPC port 10006). Click the Green Arrow to run the
client. 

**Via the command line:**

Run the following gradle task:

     ../gradlew runExampleClientRPC
     
From either `kotlin-source` or `java-source` directory depending which one you are running.
The RPC client should output some IOUs to the console.

## Running the Nodes Across Multiple Machines

The nodes can also be set up to communicate between separate machines.

After deploying the nodes, navigate to the build folder (`kotlin-source/build/
nodes` or `java-source/build/nodes`) and move some of the individual node folders to
separate machines (e.g. using a USB key). It is important 
that no nodes - including the controller node - end up on more than one 
machine. Each computer should also have a copy of `runnodes` and 
`runnodes.bat`.

For example, you may end up with the following layout:

* Machine 1: `controller`, `nodea`, `runnodes`, `runnodes.bat`
* Machine 2: `nodeb`, `nodec`, `runnodes`, `runnodes.bat`

You must now edit the configuration file for each node, including the 
controller. Open each node's config file (`[nodeName]/node.conf`), and make 
the following changes:

* Change the P2P address, the RPC address and the web address to the machine's ip 
address (e.g. `p2pAddress="10.18.0.166:10006"`)
* Change the network map address to the ip address of the machine where the 
controller node is running (e.g. `networkMapService { address="10.18.0.166:10002" ... }`) 
(please note that the network map itself will not have a network map address)

Each machine should now run its nodes using `runnodes` or `runnodes.bat` 
files. Once they are up and running, the nodes should be able to agree 
IOUs among themselves in the same way as when they were running on 
the same machine.
